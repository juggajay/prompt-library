## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (React/Vite)
```
User clicks "Generate Rules"
    ↓
ProjectRulesGenerator component
    ↓
Calls API routes via fetch()
    ↓
Displays conversation UI
    ↓
Shows generated rules
```

### Backend (Vercel Serverless Functions)
```
/api/rules/analyze-prompt
    ↓ Calls OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
    Analyzes prompt text
    Detects: project_type, technologies, requirements
    Generates 5-7 adaptive questions
    ↓ Saves to Supabase
    Creates rule_generation_session

/api/rules/conversation
    ↓ For each user answer
    Saves user response
    Returns next question OR triggers generation

/api/rules/generate
    ↓ Calls OpenAI GPT-4o
    Generates comprehensive rules
    Organized by category
    Includes config files, examples, rationale
    ↓ Saves to Supabase
    Updates session status to 'completed'
```

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
```
rule_generation_sessions
├── Session metadata
├── Project type & technologies
├── Questions asked
├── User responses
└── Generated rules (JSON)

rule_conversation_messages
├── Individual messages
├── Assistant questions
└── User answers

project_rule_templates (future)
├── Reusable rule sets
└── Public/private sharing
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Prompt Analysis (2-5 seconds)
- User clicks "Generate Rules" on a prompt card
- API analyzes prompt content using GPT-4o-mini
- Detects:
  - Project type (web_app, mobile_app, api, etc.)
  - Technologies (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - Requirements (auth, payments, real-time, etc.)
  - Industry (healthcare, finance, etc.)
  - Scale indicators (enterprise, small team, etc.)

### Step 2: Question Generation (1-2 seconds)
- AI generates 5-7 targeted questions based on analysis
- Questions are specific to detected project type
- Examples:
  - "What state management library will you use?" (for React apps)
  - "Expected monthly API request volume?" (for APIs)
  - "HIPAA compliance required?" (for healthcare)

### Step 3: Interactive Conversation (2-3 minutes)
- User answers each question
- Can be:
  - Text input ("Redux Toolkit")
  - Number input ("10,000 users")
  - Multiple choice buttons ("PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "MySQL")
- Progress bar shows completion (e.g., "Question 3 of 7")
- Each answer is saved to database

### Step 4: Rule Generation (10-15 seconds)
- AI uses GPT-4o to generate comprehensive rules
- Input: project type + technologies + all user answers
- Output: JSON structure with:
  - **Rules by category:**
    - Code Style (functional components, naming conventions)
    - Security (auth, encryption, input validation)
    - Performance (lazy loading, caching, optimization)
    - Testing (unit tests, integration tests, coverage)
    - Architecture (folder structure, patterns, separation)
    - Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 if applicable)
  - **Config files:** .eslintrc, .prettierrc, tsconfig.json
  - **Recommended tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Jest, etc.
  - **Implementation guide:** Step-by-step setup

### Step 5: Review & Download
- Rules displayed in categorized, expandable cards
- Each rule shows:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Rationale (why it matters)
  - Priority (P0=Critical, P1=High, P2=Medium, P3=Low)
  - Example code (good vs bad)
  - Enforcement method (ESLint, manual review, etc.)
- User can download as JSON
- Can use with Claude Code for automated application

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per Session
- Prompt analysis: ~1,000 tokens × $0.002 = **$0.002**
- Question generation: ~1,500 tokens × $0.002 = **$0.003**
- 5-7 Q&A rounds: ~3,000 tokens × $0.002 = **$0.006**
- Rule generation: ~5,000 tokens × $0.015 = **$0.015**

**Total per session: ~$0.026** (less than 3 cents!)

### Monthly Estimates
- 10 users: $0.26/month
- 50 users: $1.30/month
- 100 users: $2.60/month
- 500 users: $13.00/month

**Incredibly cost-effective!**

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before
❌ User creates prompt
❌ Has to manually write development rules
❌ Takes hours to research best practices
❌ Rules may be generic or incomplete
❌ No consistency across projects

### After
✅ User creates prompt
✅ Clicks one button: "Generate Rules"
✅ Answers 5-7 quick questions (3-5 minutes)
✅ Gets 20+ customized, project-specific rules
✅ Rules include examples, rationale, priorities
✅ Can download and apply immediately
✅ Consistent quality across all projects

**Time saved: 2-4 hours per project!**
