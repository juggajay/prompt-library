## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

### Code Implementation
- ‚úÖ API routes created (`/api/rules/analyze-prompt`, `/api/rules/conversation`, `/api/rules/generate`)
- ‚úÖ React component created (`ProjectRulesGenerator.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Component integrated into `PromptCard.tsx`

2. **Deploy to Vercel** (10 minutes) - Deploy and configure environment variables

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### STEP 1: Setup Database (5 minutes)

#### 1.1 Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select your project: `ihpojtawsvzawycxkhzy`
- Click: **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

#### 1.2 Run Migration
1. Click **New Query**
2. Open file: `supabase/migrations/create_rule_generation_tables.sql`
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

#### 1.3 Verify Success
Run this query to verify:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name LIKE 'rule_%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected output:**
```
rule_conversation_messages
rule_generation_sessions
```

‚úÖ **Database setup complete!**

---

### STEP 2: Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

#### 2.1 Get Supabase Service Role Key

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Scroll to **Project API keys**
4. Copy the **service_role** key (the long one, not the anon key)
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This key is secret! Never commit it to Git.

#### 2.2 Deploy to Vercel

   - Select your GitHub repository: `prompt-library`
   - Click **Import**

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Before clicking Deploy, add these environment variables:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key from .env.local>

   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<paste your service role key here>

   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your Supabase URL from .env.local>

   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your Supabase anon key from .env.local>

   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key from .env.local>
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - ‚úÖ Deployment complete!

##### Option B: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# When prompted for environment variables, add them one by one
```

### STEP 3: Test the Feature (15 minutes)

#### 3.1 Access Your Deployed App
- Go to your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://prompt-library.vercel.app`)
- Login with your account

#### 3.2 Test Basic Flow

**Test Case: E-commerce Web App**

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Click on Dashboard
   - You should see your existing prompts

2. **Create a Test Prompt** (or use existing)
   - Title: "E-commerce Platform"
   - Content: "Build a React e-commerce website with user auth, shopping cart, and Stripe payment processing"
   - Category: "Development"
   - Click Save

3. **Generate Rules**
   - Find the prompt card
   - Click **Generate Rules** button
   - ‚úÖ Should show purple gradient card with "Start Rule Generation"

4. **Start the Process**
   - Click **Start Rule Generation**
   - ‚úÖ Should show loading spinner
   - ‚úÖ After 2-5 seconds, should show:
     - "I've analyzed your prompt..."
     - Detected project type (e.g., "web app")
     - First question

5. **Answer Questions**
   - Answer 5-7 questions as they appear
   - ‚úÖ Progress bar should update
   - ‚úÖ Each answer should trigger next question

6. **View Generated Rules**
   - After last question, wait 10-15 seconds
   - ‚úÖ Should show: "Rules Generated Successfully!"
   - ‚úÖ Should display rules organized by category
   - ‚úÖ Should show Download JSON button

7. **Download Rules**
   - Click **Download JSON**
   - ‚úÖ Should download `project-rules.json`
   - ‚úÖ Open file and verify it contains rules

#### 3.3 Verify Database

Go back to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor and run:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  project_type,
  detected_technologies,
  status,
  total_questions,
  created_at
FROM rule_generation_sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

‚úÖ **You should see your test session with status: "completed"**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Failed to analyze prompt"

**Possible Causes:**
- OpenAI API key is invalid or expired
- OpenAI API key doesn't have credits
- Rate limit reached

**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs` or Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Logs
2. Verify OpenAI API key is correct
3. Check OpenAI dashboard for usage/credits

### Issue 2: "Session not found"

**Possible Causes:**
- Database tables not created
- RLS policies preventing access
- Wrong Supabase credentials

**Solution:**
1. Verify database tables exist (see STEP 1.3)
2. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
3. Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in Vercel

### Issue 3: 404 on API routes

**Possible Causes:**
- Vercel routing not configured
- API files not deployed

**Solution:**
1. Check `vercel.json` exists in root
2. Verify `api/` folder is included in deployment
3. Redeploy: `vercel --prod --force`

### Issue 4: CORS errors

**This shouldn't happen** because API routes are same-origin, but if it does:

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're accessing via the Vercel domain (not localhost)
- Check browser console for actual error
- Verify `vercel.json` has correct rewrites

### Issue 5: "Missing environment variables"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Verify all 5 variables are set
3. Redeploy to apply changes

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Check API Logs

**Via Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Click on latest deployment
4. Click **Functions**
5. View logs for `/api/rules/*`

**Via CLI:**
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

### Monitor Costs

**OpenAI Usage:**
- Dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Expected: ~$0.026 per rule generation session
- Budget: Set alerts in OpenAI dashboard

**Vercel Usage:**
- Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard/usage
- Serverless function executions
- Bandwidth usage
