2. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Copy & Paste This File:**
   - Open: `/COMPLETE_MIGRATIONS.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter

4. **Verify Success:**
   - You should see multiple "success" messages

## What Gets Created

The migration creates:

### 1. Folders System ‚úÖ
```sql
CREATE TABLE folders (
  id, user_id, name, color, description,
  parent_folder_id, created_at, updated_at
)
```

### 2. Improvements Tracking ‚úÖ
```sql
ALTER TABLE prompts ADD COLUMN:
  - was_improved (boolean)
  - original_version (text)
  - improvement_history (jsonb)
  - folder_id (uuid)
```

### 3. Improvements Cache ‚úÖ
```sql
CREATE TABLE prompt_improvements (
  original_prompt, improved_prompt,
  changes_made, reasoning,
  clarity_score, specificity_score,
  structure_score, overall_score,
  usage_count, cost tracking...
)
```

## Error Explanations

### "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')"

**Cause:** Missing folder_id field in prompts table
**Fix:** Run migrations to add folder_id column

### "Failed to load resource: 404 (folders table)"

**Cause:** Folders table doesn't exist yet
**Fix:** Run migrations to create folders table

### "Failed to save improved prompt: 400"

**Cause:** Missing was_improved, original_version, improvement_history columns
**Fix:** Run migrations to add these columns

### "OpenAI API key not found"

**Cause:** This is EXPECTED for client-side - the key is in .env.local
**Fix:** No action needed - API route has the key
**Note:** The warning is normal, AI features work via API route

## After Migration Checklist

- [ ] Folders table exists (check Supabase Table Editor)
- [ ] Prompts table has new columns (was_improved, original_version, improvement_history, folder_id)
- [ ] Prompt_improvements table exists
- [ ] No more 404 errors in browser console
- [ ] No more 400 errors on prompt updates
- [ ] "Improve with AI" button works

---

## If Migrations Fail

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Meaning:** Tables were partially created before
**Solution:** The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`, so it's safe to re-run

### Error: "column already exists"
**Meaning:** Some columns were added before
**Solution:** Migration checks for existing columns with `IF NOT EXISTS`, safe to re-run

### Error: "permission denied"
**Meaning:** Not using service role
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged into Supabase dashboard as project owner
